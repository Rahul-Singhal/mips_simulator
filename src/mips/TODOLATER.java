1)  SIGNED AND UNSIGNED
    FOR NOW I AM WRITING ALL THE UNSIGNED INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY AS THEIR SIGNED COUNTERPARTS.
    THE STALLS AND STUFF WOULD REMAIN CONSISTENT BUT SOME TYPECASTING MAY BE NEEDED LATER TO
    GET THE CORRECT NUMERIC RESULT

2) Pseudo instructions - How to go ahead with them? 

3) Commas in the code? I have made the commas optional, what should be the correct way? 
   In my implementation, "add $t1 , $t3 $t3" will be a valid instruction.
   (This is fine and sounds like a plus point. Let it be.)

4) Instructions that will not be added to instruction list for now: 
    exit, sllb, srab, srlb
